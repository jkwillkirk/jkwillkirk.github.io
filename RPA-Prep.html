    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tab-based SPA to deconstruct the interview strategy into four key competency clusters: Security Guardian, Pragmatic Innovator, Synthesis, and Organizational Alignment. This thematic structure is chosen over a linear document scroll to allow the user to focus on one competency area at a time, preventing information overload. Within each cluster, questions are grouped into sub-categories and placed in interactive accordions to encourage active exploration and make the 100 questions manageable. This design prioritizes user-led learning and synthesis of the core strategic concepts. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: 100 competency-based questions and strategic analysis. Goal: Organize and present for user exploration. Viz/Presentation Method: The primary structure is a tabbed interface (HTML/Tailwind). The questions are organized into interactive accordion lists (HTML/JS/Tailwind). Goal: Inform. Presentation Method: Key concepts like the core hypothesis are presented in styled callout boxes (HTML/Tailwind). Interaction: The user interacts by clicking tabs to switch between competency clusters and clicking accordion headers to reveal specific question sets. This allows for a self-paced deep dive into the material. Justification: This structure breaks down a dense, text-heavy report into a digestible, interactive format, which is superior for learning and preparation than a static document. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for all interactions. NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

A rational interview process must first apply a filter to identify candidates who can operate safely in this high-stakes environment (the **Security Guardian**). Only after that foundational threshold is met will it seek to differentiate between safe candidates to find the one who can best drive the modernization agenda (the **Pragmatic Innovator**).</p>
