    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is re-architected into a stakeholder-centric model with four tabs: 1) Questions from the Technical Architect (Taras Litowczuk), 2) Questions from the Business Strategist (Sharon Adkin), 3) Synthesis & Scenario questions where their interests converge, and 4) Organizational Alignment questions. This structure is superior to the previous generic model because it allows the user to prepare for the specific mindsets and priorities of the known interviewers. Accordions within each tab group related questions, making the content digestible and focused. This design directly simulates the dual nature of the interview. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: The new intelligence briefing and the revised 100 questions. Goal: Organize and present questions based on the likely questioner. Viz/Presentation Method: A tabbed interface (HTML/Tailwind) separates content by interviewer. Interactive accordions (HTML/JS/Tailwind) group question sub-categories. Interaction: User clicks tabs to switch between interviewer perspectives and clicks accordions to drill down into specific topics. Justification: This interactive structure directly mirrors the strategic need to address two different stakeholder personas, providing a highly targeted preparation experience. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for all interactions. NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                                    <li>A user requests a flow that emails them a report with sensitive data. How would you explain to them, and potentially to Ms. Adkin, why this is a risk, while also proposing an alternative solution that meets their underlying business need?</li>
                                    <li>A business team wants to use a single, generic user account for a desktop flow for simplicity. How would you explain the technical risks to Mr. Litowczuk and the business risks to Ms. Adkin?</li>
                                    <li>Describe a decision you had to make that balanced project deadlines against the need for additional security hardening. How did you rationalize the decision to both technical and business stakeholders?</li>
