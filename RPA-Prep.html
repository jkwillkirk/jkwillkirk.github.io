    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is re-architected with a new primary tab, "Our Analytical Process," making it the default view. This new section uses accordions to detail the step-by-step analysis that led to the final strategy. The existing "Strategic Briefing," "Architect Questions," and "Strategist Questions" tabs follow. This four-tab structure provides a complete narrative, explaining the 'how' and 'why' of the strategy before presenting the questions themselves. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: All previously supplied intelligence and analysis. Goal: To create a meta-narrative explaining the analytical process. Viz/Presentation Method: A four-tab interface. The new "Analytical Process" tab uses interactive accordions to present the logical flow of our joint analysis in a digestible format. Interaction: User can now explore the entire strategic journey, from initial analysis to final preparation tool. Justification: This fulfills the user's request for a section detailing "how we worked that out," making the application a comprehensive record of the entire strategic engagement. Library/Method: Vanilla JS. NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->

                                    <p><strong class="text-slate-700">Why:</strong> The initial analysis revealed a critical contradiction. The Job Description detailed a highly technical, executional developer role. However, your past interview experience with another force involved very high-level, strategic questions. This created ambiguity about the true nature of the upcoming interview.</p>
                                    <p><strong class="text-slate-700">The Problem:</strong> We needed to resolve this conflict to create an accurate preparation strategy. Relying on the wrong assumption would lead to preparing for the wrong interview.</p>

                                    <p><strong class="text-slate-700">Why:</strong> This was the breakthrough. It provided the formal assessment framework the interviewers would be using.

                                    <p><strong class="text-slate-700">The Shift:</strong> Our focus shifted from broad speculation to a targeted analysis of how the specific competencies in the CVF would be applied to test for the skills listed in the RPA Developer job description.</p>
